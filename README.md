# Baseline Models

This is a code for baseline production using Kalman filter.
It is the implementation of the models presented in : https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11472

To use this code :
* Set the parameters, dataset path settings.yaml (The Bicycle model may show training unstabilities, contributions are welcome.)
* Run train_kalman_predict.py starts the trainning.
* Enter the name of the trained model in the load_name field of settings.yaml (should be in the form \<model>\_\<dataset>\_\<id>) 
* Run `bokeh serve --show plot_interactive.py` to open an interactive plot in the browser
* Run `python save_results.py` to save the prediction results computed on the test set
* Run `python stats_results.py` to print metrics evaluation, plot covariance matching and error histogram (from the saved results)
